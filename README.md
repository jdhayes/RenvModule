> The Environment Module System v4 introduces support for fish, lisp, tcl and R code output.
> The R interface works great:

> https://github.com/cea-hpc/modules/blob/master/init/r.R.in
>
> After installation it can typically be found here: `/usr/share/Modules/init/r.R`
>
> You can try using the very `UNOFFICIAL` [moduleInitR](https://github.com/jdhayes/moduleInitR) package which basically acts as a bootstrap.
